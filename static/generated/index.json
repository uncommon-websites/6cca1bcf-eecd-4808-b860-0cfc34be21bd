    "prompt": "A diverse group of 3-4 young professionals, ages 25-35, laughing together while animatedly planning a weekend trip in a cozy, sunlit urban apartment during golden hour.

The composition is candid and slightly dynamic, with a shallow depth of field and subtle lens flare, capturing the spark of spontaneous adventure.",
